Execution:
	I used debugging in Eclipse platform workspace. After loading Lab_1.S into
	your workspace, use 'F5' to step through the program.
	
Registers:
	X0: Holds address of array 'A'
	X1: Holds address of variable 'n'
	X2: Holds i
	X3: A[i]
	X4: Used for checking if any number greater than A[0] first, and then A[i].
		Also used for checking if any number less than A[0] first, and then A[i].
		Also used for checking if i < n to continue the loop.
	X10: Holds the total sum of array 'A'
	X11: Holds the largest value in array 'A'
	X12: Holds the smallest value in array 'A'
	X13: Holds the difference between max and min of array 'A'
